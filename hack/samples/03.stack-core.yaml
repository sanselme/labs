                          be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where `<volume name>` is the
                          name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array entry. Pod validation
                          will reject the pod if the concatenated name is not valid
                          for a PVC (for example, too long). \n An existing PVC with
                          that name that is not owned by the pod will *not* be used

                          to the pod once the pod exists. Normally this should not
                          be necessary, but it may be useful when manually reconstructing

                                  There are three important differences between dataSource
                                  and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource only allows
                                  two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef allows
                                  any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                  objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
                                  (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                  and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                  specified. * While dataSource only allows local
                                  objects, dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces.

                              allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                              objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
                              (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                              and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef
                              allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this
                              field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate
                              to be enabled. (Alpha) Using the namespace field of
                              dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource

                              of the volume. * Custom resources must use implementation-defined
                              prefixed names such as \"example.com/my-custom-resource\"
                              Apart from above values - keys that are unprefixed or
                              have kubernetes.io prefix are considered reserved and
                              hence may not be used. \n Capacity reported here may
                              be larger than the actual capacity when a volume expansion
                              operation is requested. For storage quota, the larger
                              value from allocatedResources and PVC.spec.resources
                              is used. If allocatedResources is not set, PVC.spec.resources
                              alone is used for quota calculation. If a volume expansion
                              capacity request is lowered, allocatedResources is only
                              lowered if there are no expansion operations in progress
                              and if the actual volume capacity is equal or lower
                              than the requested capacity. \n A controller that receives
                              PVC update with previously unknown resourceName should
                              ignore the update for the purpose it was designed. For
                              example - a controller that only is responsible for
                              resizing capacity of the volume, should ignore PVC updates
                              that change other valid resources associated with PVC.

                        is set to 5 and pods with the same labelSelector spread as
                        2/2/2: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                        The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so \"global
                        minimum\" is treated as 0. In this situation, new pod with
                        the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled, because computed
                        skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the
                        three zones, it will violate MaxSkew. \n This is a beta field
                        and requires the MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature gate

                                    important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types
                                    of objects, dataSourceRef allows any non-core
                                    object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping
                                    them), dataSourceRef preserves all values, and
                                    generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects,
                                    dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces.

                description: "Ancestors is a list of ancestor resources (usually Gateways)
                  that are associated with the policy, and the status of the policy
                  with respect to each ancestor. When this policy attaches to a parent,
                  the controller that manages the parent and the ancestors MUST add
                  an entry to this list when the controller first sees the policy
                  and SHOULD update the entry as appropriate when the relevant ancestor
                  is modified. \n Note that choosing the relevant ancestor is left
                  to the Policy designers; an important part of Policy design is designing
                  the right object level at which to namespace this status. \n Note
                  also that implementations MUST ONLY populate ancestor status for
                  the Ancestor resources they are responsible for. Implementations
                  MUST use the ControllerName field to uniquely identify the entries
                  in this list that they are responsible for. \n Note that to achieve
                  this, the list of PolicyAncestorStatus structs MUST be treated as
                  a map with a composite key, made up of the AncestorRef and ControllerName
                  fields combined. \n A maximum of 16 ancestors will be represented
                  in this list. An empty list means the Policy is not relevant for
                  any ancestors. \n If this slice is full, implementations MUST NOT
                  add further entries. Instead they MUST consider the policy unimplementable
                  and signal that on any related resources such as the ancestor that
                  would be referenced here. For example, if this list was full on
                  BackendTLSPolicy, no additional Gateways would be able to reference
                  the Service targeted by the BackendTLSPolicy."

                  description: "PolicyAncestorStatus describes the status of a route
                    with respect to an associated Ancestor. \n Ancestors refer to
                    objects that are either the Target of a policy or above it in
                    terms of object hierarchy. For example, if a policy targets a
                    Service, the Policy's Ancestors are, in order, the Service, the
                    HTTPRoute, the Gateway, and the GatewayClass. Almost always, in
                    this hierarchy, the Gateway will be the most useful object to
                    place Policy status on, so we recommend that implementations SHOULD
                    use Gateway as the PolicyAncestorStatus object unless the designers
                    have a _very_ good reason otherwise. \n In the context of policy
                    attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which resource
                    results in a distinct application of this policy. For example,
                    if a policy targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per
                    attached Gateway. \n Policies targeting the same resource may
                    have different effects depending on the ancestors of those resources.
                    For example, different Gateways targeting the same Service may
                    have different capabilities, especially if they have different
                    underlying implementations. \n For example, in BackendTLSPolicy,
                    the Policy attaches to a Service that is used as a backend in
                    a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway. In this case,
                    the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the
                    ancestor object referred to in this status. \n Note that a parent
                    is also an ancestor, so for objects where the parent is the relevant
                    object for status, this struct SHOULD still be used. \n This struct
                    is intended to be used in a slice that's effectively a map, with
                    a composite key made up of the AncestorRef and the ControllerName."

                            parent resource. \n When the parent resource is a Gateway,
                            this targets all listeners listening on the specified

                            a specific port as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s)
                            may be changed. When both Port and SectionName are specified,

                            both specified values. \n  When the parent resource is
                            a Service, this targets a specific port in the Service
                            spec. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are

                            how/if Port is interpreted. \n For the purpose of status,
                            an attachment is considered successful as long as the
                            parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them
                            by Route kind, namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway
                            listeners accept attachment from the referencing Route,
                            the Route MUST be considered successfully attached. If
                            no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                            the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                                          may be changed. When both Port and SectionName
                                          are specified, the name and port of the
                                          selected listener must match both specified
                                          values. \n When the parent resource is a
                                          Service, this targets a specific port in
                                          the Service spec. When both Port (experimental)
                                          and SectionName are specified, the name
                                          and port of the selected port must match
                                          both specified values. \n Implementations
                                          MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                                          Implementations supporting other types of
                                          parent resources MUST clearly document how/if
                                          Port is interpreted. \n For the purpose
                                          of status, an attachment is considered successful
                                          as long as the parent resource accepts it
                                          partially. For example, Gateway listeners
                                          can restrict which Routes can attach to
                                          them by Route kind, namespace, or hostname.
                                          If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                                          from the referencing Route, the Route MUST
                                          be considered successfully attached. If
                                          no Gateway listeners accept attachment from
                                          this Route, the Route MUST be considered

          the state of the GatewayClass at the time it was created and changes to
          the GatewayClass or associated parameters are not propagated down to existing
          Gateways. This recommendation is intended to limit the blast radius of changes
          to GatewayClass or associated parameters. If implementations choose to propagate
          GatewayClass changes to existing Gateways, that MUST be clearly documented
          by the implementation. \n Whenever one or more Gateways are using a GatewayClass,
          implementations SHOULD add the `gateway-exists-finalizer.gateway.networking.k8s.io`
          finalizer on the associated GatewayClass. This ensures that a GatewayClass

                  logical endpoints that are bound on this Gateway's addresses. At
                  least one Listener MUST be specified. \n Each Listener in a set
                  of Listeners (for example, in a single Gateway) MUST be _distinct_,
                  in that a traffic flow MUST be able to be assigned to exactly one
                  listener. (This section uses \"set of Listeners\" rather than \"Listeners
                  in a single Gateway\" because implementations MAY merge configuration
                  from multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules
                  _also_ apply in that case). \n Practically, this means that each
                  listener in a set MUST have a unique combination of Port, Protocol,
                  and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname. \n Some combinations
                  of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered Core support
                  and MUST be supported by implementations based on their targeted
                  conformance profile: \n HTTP Profile \n 1. HTTPRoute, Port: 80,
                  Protocol: HTTP 2. HTTPRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: HTTPS, TLS Mode:
                  Terminate, TLS keypair provided \n TLS Profile \n 1. TLSRoute, Port:
                  443, Protocol: TLS, TLS Mode: Passthrough \n \"Distinct\" Listeners
                  have the following property: \n The implementation can match inbound
                  requests to a single distinct Listener. When multiple Listeners
                  share values for fields (for example, two Listeners with the same
                  Port value), the implementation can match requests to only one of
                  the Listeners using other Listener fields. \n For example, the following
                  Listener scenarios are distinct: \n 1. Multiple Listeners with the
                  same Port that all use the \"HTTP\" Protocol that all have unique
                  Hostname values. 2. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that use
                  either the \"HTTPS\" or \"TLS\" Protocol that all have unique Hostname
                  values. 3. A mixture of \"TCP\" and \"UDP\" Protocol Listeners,
                  where no Listener with the same Protocol has the same Port value.
                  \n Some fields in the Listener struct have possible values that
                  affect whether the Listener is distinct. Hostname is particularly
                  relevant for HTTP or HTTPS protocols. \n When using the Hostname
                  value to select between same-Port, same-Protocol Listeners, the
                  Hostname value must be different on each Listener for the Listener
                  to be distinct. \n When the Listeners are distinct based on Hostname,
                  inbound request hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least
                  specific Hostname values to choose the correct Listener and its
                  associated set of Routes. \n Exact matches must be processed before
                  wildcard matches, and wildcard matches must be processed before
                  fallback (empty Hostname value) matches. For example, `\"foo.example.com\"`
                  takes precedence over `\"*.example.com\"`, and `\"*.example.com\"`
                  takes precedence over `\"\"`. \n Additionally, if there are multiple
                  wildcard entries, more specific wildcard entries must be processed
                  before less specific wildcard entries. For example, `\"*.foo.example.com\"`
                  takes precedence over `\"*.example.com\"`. The precise definition
                  here is that the higher the number of dots in the hostname to the
                  right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence. \n The
                  wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_
                  to the left, however, so `\"*.example.com\"` will match both `\"foo.bar.example.com\"`
                  _and_ `\"bar.example.com\"`. \n If a set of Listeners contains Listeners
                  that are not distinct, then those Listeners are Conflicted, and
                  the implementation MUST set the \"Conflicted\" condition in the
                  Listener Status to \"True\". \n Implementations MAY choose to accept
                  a Gateway with some Conflicted Listeners only if they only accept
                  the partial Listener set that contains no Conflicted Listeners.
                  To put this another way, implementations may accept a partial Listener
                  set only if they throw out *all* the conflicting Listeners. No picking
                  one of the conflicting listeners as the winner. This also means
                  that the Gateway must have at least one non-conflicting Listener
                  in this case, otherwise it violates the requirement that at least
                  one Listener must be present. \n The implementation MUST set a \"ListenersNotValid\"
                  condition on the Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted
                  Listeners whether or not they accept the Gateway. That Condition
                  SHOULD clearly indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted,
                  and which are Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those
                  listeners SHOULD indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not
                  Accepted. \n A Gateway's Listeners are considered \"compatible\"
                  if: \n 1. They are distinct. 2. The implementation can serve them
                  in compliance with the Addresses requirement that all Listeners
                  are available on all assigned addresses. \n Compatible combinations
                  in Extended support are expected to vary across implementations.
                  A combination that is compatible for one implementation may not
                  be compatible for another. \n For example, an implementation that
                  cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners on the same address, or
                  cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port would
                  not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.
                  \n Note that requests SHOULD match at most one Listener. For example,
                  if Listeners are defined for \"foo.example.com\" and \"*.example.com\",
                  a request to \"foo.example.com\" SHOULD only be routed using routes
                  attached to the \"foo.example.com\" Listener (and not the \"*.example.com\"
                  Listener). This concept is known as \"Listener Isolation\". Implementations
                  that do not support Listener Isolation MUST clearly document this.
                  \n Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set
                  of Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.

                        specific Listener as a parent resource (more detail on attachment
                        semantics can be found in the documentation on the various
                        Route kinds ParentRefs fields). Listener or Route status does
                        not impact successful attachment, i.e. the AttachedRoutes

                  logical endpoints that are bound on this Gateway's addresses. At
                  least one Listener MUST be specified. \n Each Listener in a set
                  of Listeners (for example, in a single Gateway) MUST be _distinct_,
                  in that a traffic flow MUST be able to be assigned to exactly one
                  listener. (This section uses \"set of Listeners\" rather than \"Listeners
                  in a single Gateway\" because implementations MAY merge configuration
                  from multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules
                  _also_ apply in that case). \n Practically, this means that each
                  listener in a set MUST have a unique combination of Port, Protocol,
                  and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname. \n Some combinations
                  of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered Core support
                  and MUST be supported by implementations based on their targeted
                  conformance profile: \n HTTP Profile \n 1. HTTPRoute, Port: 80,
                  Protocol: HTTP 2. HTTPRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: HTTPS, TLS Mode:
                  Terminate, TLS keypair provided \n TLS Profile \n 1. TLSRoute, Port:
                  443, Protocol: TLS, TLS Mode: Passthrough \n \"Distinct\" Listeners
                  have the following property: \n The implementation can match inbound
                  requests to a single distinct Listener. When multiple Listeners
                  share values for fields (for example, two Listeners with the same
                  Port value), the implementation can match requests to only one of
                  the Listeners using other Listener fields. \n For example, the following
                  Listener scenarios are distinct: \n 1. Multiple Listeners with the
                  same Port that all use the \"HTTP\" Protocol that all have unique
                  Hostname values. 2. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that use
                  either the \"HTTPS\" or \"TLS\" Protocol that all have unique Hostname
                  values. 3. A mixture of \"TCP\" and \"UDP\" Protocol Listeners,
                  where no Listener with the same Protocol has the same Port value.
                  \n Some fields in the Listener struct have possible values that
                  affect whether the Listener is distinct. Hostname is particularly
                  relevant for HTTP or HTTPS protocols. \n When using the Hostname
                  value to select between same-Port, same-Protocol Listeners, the
                  Hostname value must be different on each Listener for the Listener
                  to be distinct. \n When the Listeners are distinct based on Hostname,
                  inbound request hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least
                  specific Hostname values to choose the correct Listener and its
                  associated set of Routes. \n Exact matches must be processed before
                  wildcard matches, and wildcard matches must be processed before
                  fallback (empty Hostname value) matches. For example, `\"foo.example.com\"`
                  takes precedence over `\"*.example.com\"`, and `\"*.example.com\"`
                  takes precedence over `\"\"`. \n Additionally, if there are multiple
                  wildcard entries, more specific wildcard entries must be processed
                  before less specific wildcard entries. For example, `\"*.foo.example.com\"`
                  takes precedence over `\"*.example.com\"`. The precise definition
                  here is that the higher the number of dots in the hostname to the
                  right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence. \n The
                  wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_
                  to the left, however, so `\"*.example.com\"` will match both `\"foo.bar.example.com\"`
                  _and_ `\"bar.example.com\"`. \n If a set of Listeners contains Listeners
                  that are not distinct, then those Listeners are Conflicted, and
                  the implementation MUST set the \"Conflicted\" condition in the
                  Listener Status to \"True\". \n Implementations MAY choose to accept
                  a Gateway with some Conflicted Listeners only if they only accept
                  the partial Listener set that contains no Conflicted Listeners.
                  To put this another way, implementations may accept a partial Listener
                  set only if they throw out *all* the conflicting Listeners. No picking
                  one of the conflicting listeners as the winner. This also means
                  that the Gateway must have at least one non-conflicting Listener
                  in this case, otherwise it violates the requirement that at least
                  one Listener must be present. \n The implementation MUST set a \"ListenersNotValid\"
                  condition on the Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted
                  Listeners whether or not they accept the Gateway. That Condition
                  SHOULD clearly indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted,
                  and which are Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those
                  listeners SHOULD indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not
                  Accepted. \n A Gateway's Listeners are considered \"compatible\"
                  if: \n 1. They are distinct. 2. The implementation can serve them
                  in compliance with the Addresses requirement that all Listeners
                  are available on all assigned addresses. \n Compatible combinations
                  in Extended support are expected to vary across implementations.
                  A combination that is compatible for one implementation may not
                  be compatible for another. \n For example, an implementation that
                  cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners on the same address, or
                  cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port would
                  not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.
                  \n Note that requests SHOULD match at most one Listener. For example,
                  if Listeners are defined for \"foo.example.com\" and \"*.example.com\",
                  a request to \"foo.example.com\" SHOULD only be routed using routes
                  attached to the \"foo.example.com\" Listener (and not the \"*.example.com\"
                  Listener). This concept is known as \"Listener Isolation\". Implementations
                  that do not support Listener Isolation MUST clearly document this.
                  \n Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set
                  of Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.

                        over a Route with a creation timestamp of \"2020-09-08 01:02:04\".

                  This matches the RFC 1123 definition of a hostname with 2 notable
                  exceptions: \n 1. IPs are not allowed. 2. A hostname may be prefixed
                  with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard label MUST appear by
                  itself as the first label. \n If a hostname is specified by both
                  the Listener and GRPCRoute, there MUST be at least one intersecting
                  hostname for the GRPCRoute to be attached to the Listener. For example:
                  \n * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches
                  GRPCRoutes that have either not specified any hostnames, or have

                  that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified at
                  least one hostname that matches the Listener hostname. For example,
                  `test.example.com` and `*.example.com` would both match. On the
                  other hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net` would not match.
                  \n Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are
                  interpreted as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com`

                  but not `example.com`. \n If both the Listener and GRPCRoute have
                  specified hostnames, any GRPCRoute hostnames that do not match the
                  Listener hostname MUST be ignored. For example, if a Listener specified
                  `*.example.com`, and the GRPCRoute specified `test.example.com`
                  and `test.example.net`, `test.example.net` MUST NOT be considered
                  for a match. \n If both the Listener and GRPCRoute have specified
                  hostnames, and none match with the criteria above, then the GRPCRoute
                  MUST NOT be accepted by the implementation. The implementation MUST

                  is attached to a Listener and that listener already has another
                  Route (B) of the other type attached and the intersection of the

                  that a Route wants to be attached to. Note that the referenced parent
                  resource needs to allow this for the attachment to be complete.
                  For Gateways, that means the Gateway needs to allow attachment from
                  Routes of this kind and namespace. For Services, that means the
                  Service must either be in the same namespace for a \"producer\"
                  route, or the mesh implementation must support and allow \"consumer\"
                  routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is not applicable
                  for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to create
                  a \"producer\" route for a Service in a different namespace from
                  the Route. \n There are two kinds of parent resources with \"Core\"
                  support: \n * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)  * Service (Mesh
                  conformance profile, experimental, ClusterIP Services only)  This
                  API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of
                  parent resources. \n ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either
                  that: \n * They select different objects.  If this is the case,
                  then parentRef entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means
                  that the multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`,
                  and `name` must be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
                  * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field
                  used, each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same
                  set of optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets
                  a combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.
                  \n Some examples: \n * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all
                  ParentRefs referencing the same object must also set `sectionName`.
                  * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
                  object must also set `port`. * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`
                  and `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same object must also
                  set `sectionName` and `port`. \n It is possible to separately reference
                  multiple distinct objects that may be collapsed by an implementation.
                  For example, some implementations may choose to merge compatible
                  Gateway Listeners together. If that is the case, the list of routes
                  attached to those resources should also be merged. \n Note that
                  for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
                  rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                  allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For
                  example, Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant

                              corresponding configuration defined by \"Support: Extended\"
                              in this package, e.g. \"RequestMirror\". Implementers

                              Filters that are defined and supported by specific vendors.
                              In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior
                              across multiple implementations will be considered for
                              inclusion in extended or core conformance levels. Filter-specific
                              configuration for such filters is specified using the

                              for custom filters. \n Implementers are encouraged to
                              define custom implementation types to extend the core
                              API with implementation-specific behavior. \n If a reference
                              to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter

                description: "Hostnames defines a set of hostnames that should match
                  against the HTTP Host header to select a HTTPRoute used to process
                  the request. Implementations MUST ignore any port value specified
                  in the HTTP Host header while performing a match and (absent of
                  any applicable header modification configuration) MUST forward this
                  header unmodified to the backend. \n Valid values for Hostnames
                  are determined by RFC 1123 definition of a hostname with 2 notable
                  exceptions: \n 1. IPs are not allowed. 2. A hostname may be prefixed
                  with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard label must appear by
                  itself as the first label. \n If a hostname is specified by both
                  the Listener and HTTPRoute, there must be at least one intersecting
                  hostname for the HTTPRoute to be attached to the Listener. For example:
                  \n * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches
                  HTTPRoutes that have either not specified any hostnames, or have
                  specified at least one of `test.example.com` or `*.example.com`.
                  * A Listener with `*.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes
                  that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified at
                  least one hostname that matches the Listener hostname. For example,
                  `*.example.com`, `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`
                  would all match. On the other hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net`
                  would not match. \n Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard
                  label (`*.`) are interpreted as a suffix match. That means that
                  a match for `*.example.com` would match both `test.example.com`,
                  and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`. \n If both the
                  Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, any HTTPRoute hostnames
                  that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be ignored. For example,
                  if a Listener specified `*.example.com`, and the HTTPRoute specified
                  `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`, `test.example.net` must
                  not be considered for a match. \n If both the Listener and HTTPRoute
                  have specified hostnames, and none match with the criteria above,
                  then the HTTPRoute is not accepted. The implementation must raise
                  an 'Accepted' Condition with a status of `False` in the corresponding
                  RouteParentStatus. \n In the event that multiple HTTPRoutes specify
                  intersecting hostnames (e.g. overlapping wildcard matching and exact
                  matching hostnames), precedence must be given to rules from the
                  HTTPRoute with the largest number of: \n * Characters in a matching
                  non-wildcard hostname. * Characters in a matching hostname. \n If
                  ties exist across multiple Routes, the matching precedence rules
                  for HTTPRouteMatches takes over. \n Support: Core"

                  that a Route wants to be attached to. Note that the referenced parent
                  resource needs to allow this for the attachment to be complete.
                  For Gateways, that means the Gateway needs to allow attachment from
                  Routes of this kind and namespace. For Services, that means the
                  Service must either be in the same namespace for a \"producer\"
                  route, or the mesh implementation must support and allow \"consumer\"
                  routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is not applicable
                  for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to create
                  a \"producer\" route for a Service in a different namespace from
                  the Route. \n There are two kinds of parent resources with \"Core\"
                  support: \n * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)  * Service (Mesh
                  conformance profile, experimental, ClusterIP Services only)  This
                  API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of
                  parent resources. \n ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either
                  that: \n * They select different objects.  If this is the case,
                  then parentRef entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means
                  that the multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`,
                  and `name` must be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
                  * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field
                  used, each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same
                  set of optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets
                  a combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.
                  \n Some examples: \n * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all
                  ParentRefs referencing the same object must also set `sectionName`.
                  * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
                  object must also set `port`. * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`
                  and `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same object must also
                  set `sectionName` and `port`. \n It is possible to separately reference
                  multiple distinct objects that may be collapsed by an implementation.
                  For example, some implementations may choose to merge compatible
                  Gateway Listeners together. If that is the case, the list of routes
                  attached to those resources should also be merged. \n Note that
                  for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
                  rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                  allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For
                  example, Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant
                  provides a generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace
                  reference. \n  ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same
                  namespace are \"producer\" routes, which apply default routing rules
                  to inbound connections from any namespace to the Service. \n ParentRefs
                  from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are \"consumer\"
                  routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound connections
                  originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which the
                  intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as

                                            A path element refers to the list of labels
                                            in the path split by the `/` separator.
                                            When specified, a trailing `/` is ignored.
                                            For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`,
                                            and `/abc/def` would all match the prefix
                                            `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.

                                    be resolved, the filter MUST NOT be skipped. Instead,

                                            redirect. For example, a request to \"/foo/bar\"
                                            with a prefix match of \"/foo\" and a

                                            modified to \"/xyz/bar\". \n Note that
                                            this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix
                                            match type. This matches full path elements.
                                            A path element refers to the list of labels
                                            in the path split by the `/` separator.
                                            When specified, a trailing `/` is ignored.
                                            For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`,
                                            and `/abc/def` would all match the prefix
                                            `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.
                                            \n ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible
                                            with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch. Using

                              As with other API fields, types are classified into
                              three conformance levels: \n - Core: Filter types and
                              their corresponding configuration defined by \"Support:
                              Core\" in this package, e.g. \"RequestHeaderModifier\".
                              All implementations must support core filters. \n -
                              Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration
                              defined by \"Support: Extended\" in this package, e.g.
                              \"RequestMirror\". Implementers are encouraged to support
                              extended filters. \n - Implementation-specific: Filters
                              that are defined and supported by specific vendors.
                              In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior
                              across multiple implementations will be considered for
                              inclusion in extended or core conformance levels. Filter-specific
                              configuration for such filters is specified using the
                              ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to \"ExtensionRef\"
                              for custom filters. \n Implementers are encouraged to
                              define custom implementation types to extend the core
                              API with implementation-specific behavior. \n If a reference
                              to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                              MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have
                              been processed by that filter MUST receive a HTTP error
                              response. \n Note that values may be added to this enum,
                              implementations must ensure that unknown values will

                                      match of \"/foo\" and a ReplacePrefixMatch of
                                      \"/xyz\" would be modified to \"/xyz/bar\".

                                      elements. A path element refers to the list
                                      of labels in the path split by the `/` separator.
                                      When specified, a trailing `/` is ignored. For
                                      example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def`
                                      would all match the prefix `/abc`, but the path
                                      `/abcd` would not. \n ReplacePrefixMatch is
                                      only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                      Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same
                                      HTTPRouteRule will result in the implementation

                        is satisfied. \n For example, take the following matches configuration:
                        \n ``` matches: - path: value: \"/foo\" headers: - name: \"version\"
                        value: \"v2\" - path: value: \"/v2/foo\" ``` \n For a request
                        to match against this rule, a request must satisfy EITHER
                        of the two conditions: \n - path prefixed with `/foo` AND
                        contains the header `version: v2` - path prefix of `/v2/foo`
                        \n See the documentation for HTTPRouteMatch on how to specify
                        multiple match conditions that should be ANDed together. \n
                        If no matches are specified, the default is a prefix path
                        match on \"/\", which has the effect of matching every HTTP
                        request. \n Proxy or Load Balancer routing configuration generated
                        from HTTPRoutes MUST prioritize matches based on the following
                        criteria, continuing on ties. Across all rules specified on
                        applicable Routes, precedence must be given to the match having:
                        \n * \"Exact\" path match. * \"Prefix\" path match with largest
                        number of characters. * Method match. * Largest number of
                        header matches. * Largest number of query param matches. \n
                        Note: The precedence of RegularExpression path matches are
                        implementation-specific. \n If ties still exist across multiple
                        Routes, matching precedence MUST be determined in order of
                        the following criteria, continuing on ties: \n * The oldest
                        Route based on creation timestamp. * The Route appearing first
                        in alphabetical order by \"{namespace}/{name}\". \n If ties
                        still exist within an HTTPRoute, matching precedence MUST
                        be granted to the FIRST matching rule (in list order) with
                        a match meeting the above criteria. \n When no rules matching
                        a request have been successfully attached to the parent a
                        request is coming from, a HTTP 404 status code MUST be returned."

                description: "Hostnames defines a set of hostnames that should match
                  against the HTTP Host header to select a HTTPRoute used to process
                  the request. Implementations MUST ignore any port value specified
                  in the HTTP Host header while performing a match and (absent of
                  any applicable header modification configuration) MUST forward this
                  header unmodified to the backend. \n Valid values for Hostnames
                  are determined by RFC 1123 definition of a hostname with 2 notable
                  exceptions: \n 1. IPs are not allowed. 2. A hostname may be prefixed
                  with a wildcard label (`*.`). The wildcard label must appear by
                  itself as the first label. \n If a hostname is specified by both
                  the Listener and HTTPRoute, there must be at least one intersecting
                  hostname for the HTTPRoute to be attached to the Listener. For example:
                  \n * A Listener with `test.example.com` as the hostname matches
                  HTTPRoutes that have either not specified any hostnames, or have
                  specified at least one of `test.example.com` or `*.example.com`.
                  * A Listener with `*.example.com` as the hostname matches HTTPRoutes
                  that have either not specified any hostnames or have specified at
                  least one hostname that matches the Listener hostname. For example,
                  `*.example.com`, `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`
                  would all match. On the other hand, `example.com` and `test.example.net`
                  would not match. \n Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard
                  label (`*.`) are interpreted as a suffix match. That means that
                  a match for `*.example.com` would match both `test.example.com`,
                  and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`. \n If both the
                  Listener and HTTPRoute have specified hostnames, any HTTPRoute hostnames
                  that do not match the Listener hostname MUST be ignored. For example,
                  if a Listener specified `*.example.com`, and the HTTPRoute specified
                  `test.example.com` and `test.example.net`, `test.example.net` must
                  not be considered for a match. \n If both the Listener and HTTPRoute
                  have specified hostnames, and none match with the criteria above,
                  then the HTTPRoute is not accepted. The implementation must raise
                  an 'Accepted' Condition with a status of `False` in the corresponding
                  RouteParentStatus. \n In the event that multiple HTTPRoutes specify
                  intersecting hostnames (e.g. overlapping wildcard matching and exact
                  matching hostnames), precedence must be given to rules from the
                  HTTPRoute with the largest number of: \n * Characters in a matching
                  non-wildcard hostname. * Characters in a matching hostname. \n If
                  ties exist across multiple Routes, the matching precedence rules

                  that a Route wants to be attached to. Note that the referenced parent
                  resource needs to allow this for the attachment to be complete.
                  For Gateways, that means the Gateway needs to allow attachment from
                  Routes of this kind and namespace. For Services, that means the
                  Service must either be in the same namespace for a \"producer\"
                  route, or the mesh implementation must support and allow \"consumer\"
                  routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is not applicable
                  for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to create
                  a \"producer\" route for a Service in a different namespace from
                  the Route. \n There are two kinds of parent resources with \"Core\"
                  support: \n * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)  * Service (Mesh
                  conformance profile, experimental, ClusterIP Services only)  This
                  API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of
                  parent resources. \n ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either
                  that: \n * They select different objects.  If this is the case,
                  then parentRef entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means
                  that the multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`,
                  and `name` must be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
                  * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field
                  used, each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same
                  set of optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets
                  a combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.
                  \n Some examples: \n * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all
                  ParentRefs referencing the same object must also set `sectionName`.
                  * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
                  object must also set `port`. * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`
                  and `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same object must also
                  set `sectionName` and `port`. \n It is possible to separately reference
                  multiple distinct objects that may be collapsed by an implementation.
                  For example, some implementations may choose to merge compatible
                  Gateway Listeners together. If that is the case, the list of routes
                  attached to those resources should also be merged. \n Note that
                  for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
                  rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                  allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For
                  example, Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant
                  provides a generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace
                  reference. \n  ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same
                  namespace are \"producer\" routes, which apply default routing rules
                  to inbound connections from any namespace to the Service. \n ParentRefs
                  from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are \"consumer\"
                  routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound connections
                  originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which the

                                            in the path split by the `/` separator.
                                            When specified, a trailing `/` is ignored.
                                            For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`,
                                            and `/abc/def` would all match the prefix
                                            `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.

                                    must support core filters. \n - Extended: Filter
                                    types and their corresponding configuration defined

                                    to support extended filters. \n - Implementation-specific:
                                    Filters that are defined and supported by specific
                                    vendors. In the future, filters showing convergence

                                    field. `Type` should be set to \"ExtensionRef\"
                                    for custom filters. \n Implementers are encouraged

                                    the core API with implementation-specific behavior.

                                    be resolved, the filter MUST NOT be skipped. Instead,
                                    requests that would have been processed by that
                                    filter MUST receive a HTTP error response. \n

                                            redirect. For example, a request to \"/foo/bar\"
                                            with a prefix match of \"/foo\" and a
                                            ReplacePrefixMatch of \"/xyz\" would be
                                            modified to \"/xyz/bar\". \n Note that
                                            this matches the behavior of the PathPrefix
                                            match type. This matches full path elements.
                                            A path element refers to the list of labels
                                            in the path split by the `/` separator.
                                            When specified, a trailing `/` is ignored.
                                            For example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`,
                                            and `/abc/def` would all match the prefix
                                            `/abc`, but the path `/abcd` would not.
                                            \n ReplacePrefixMatch is only compatible
                                            with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch. Using
                                            any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same
                                            HTTPRouteRule will result in the implementation

                              As with other API fields, types are classified into
                              three conformance levels: \n - Core: Filter types and
                              their corresponding configuration defined by \"Support:
                              Core\" in this package, e.g. \"RequestHeaderModifier\".
                              All implementations must support core filters. \n -
                              Extended: Filter types and their corresponding configuration
                              defined by \"Support: Extended\" in this package, e.g.
                              \"RequestMirror\". Implementers are encouraged to support
                              extended filters. \n - Implementation-specific: Filters
                              that are defined and supported by specific vendors.
                              In the future, filters showing convergence in behavior
                              across multiple implementations will be considered for
                              inclusion in extended or core conformance levels. Filter-specific
                              configuration for such filters is specified using the
                              ExtensionRef field. `Type` should be set to \"ExtensionRef\"
                              for custom filters. \n Implementers are encouraged to
                              define custom implementation types to extend the core
                              API with implementation-specific behavior. \n If a reference
                              to a custom filter type cannot be resolved, the filter
                              MUST NOT be skipped. Instead, requests that would have
                              been processed by that filter MUST receive a HTTP error
                              response. \n Note that values may be added to this enum,
                              implementations must ensure that unknown values will

                                      of a request during a rewrite or redirect. For
                                      example, a request to \"/foo/bar\" with a prefix
                                      match of \"/foo\" and a ReplacePrefixMatch of
                                      \"/xyz\" would be modified to \"/xyz/bar\".

                                      elements. A path element refers to the list
                                      of labels in the path split by the `/` separator.
                                      When specified, a trailing `/` is ignored. For
                                      example, the paths `/abc`, `/abc/`, and `/abc/def`
                                      would all match the prefix `/abc`, but the path
                                      `/abcd` would not. \n ReplacePrefixMatch is
                                      only compatible with a `PathPrefix` HTTPRouteMatch.
                                      Using any other HTTPRouteMatch type on the same
                                      HTTPRouteRule will result in the implementation

                        is satisfied. \n For example, take the following matches configuration:
                        \n ``` matches: - path: value: \"/foo\" headers: - name: \"version\"
                        value: \"v2\" - path: value: \"/v2/foo\" ``` \n For a request
                        to match against this rule, a request must satisfy EITHER
                        of the two conditions: \n - path prefixed with `/foo` AND
                        contains the header `version: v2` - path prefix of `/v2/foo`
                        \n See the documentation for HTTPRouteMatch on how to specify
                        multiple match conditions that should be ANDed together. \n
                        If no matches are specified, the default is a prefix path
                        match on \"/\", which has the effect of matching every HTTP
                        request. \n Proxy or Load Balancer routing configuration generated
                        from HTTPRoutes MUST prioritize matches based on the following
                        criteria, continuing on ties. Across all rules specified on
                        applicable Routes, precedence must be given to the match having:
                        \n * \"Exact\" path match. * \"Prefix\" path match with largest
                        number of characters. * Method match. * Largest number of
                        header matches. * Largest number of query param matches. \n
                        Note: The precedence of RegularExpression path matches are
                        implementation-specific. \n If ties still exist across multiple
                        Routes, matching precedence MUST be determined in order of
                        the following criteria, continuing on ties: \n * The oldest
                        Route based on creation timestamp. * The Route appearing first
                        in alphabetical order by \"{namespace}/{name}\". \n If ties
                        still exist within an HTTPRoute, matching precedence MUST
                        be granted to the FIRST matching rule (in list order) with
                        a match meeting the above criteria. \n When no rules matching
                        a request have been successfully attached to the parent a
                        request is coming from, a HTTP 404 status code MUST be returned."

                        For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                        the restart behavior is defined by the Pod''s restart policy

                        init container will be continually restarted on exit until
                        all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular containers

                        Although this init container still starts in the init container
                        sequence, it does not wait for the container to complete before
                        proceeding to the next init container. Instead, the next init

                                  and generates an error if a disallowed value is

                              when namespace isn''t specified in dataSourceRef, both

                              between dataSource and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource
                              only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                              allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                              objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
                              (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                              and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef
                              allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this

                                    object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping
                                    them), dataSourceRef preserves all values, and
                                    generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects,
                                    dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces.

                        For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                        the restart behavior is defined by the Pod''s restart policy

                        for the init container will have the following effect: this
                        init container will be continually restarted on exit until
                        all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular containers
                        have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                        will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init
                        containers and is often referred to as a "sidecar" container.
                        Although this init container still starts in the init container
                        sequence, it does not wait for the container to complete before
                        proceeding to the next init container. Instead, the next init

                          is embedded will be the owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will
                          be deleted together with the pod.  The name of the PVC will
                          be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where `<volume name>` is the
                          name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array entry. Pod validation
                          will reject the pod if the concatenated name is not valid
                          for a PVC (for example, too long). \n An existing PVC with
                          that name that is not owned by the pod will *not* be used
                          for the pod to avoid using an unrelated volume by mistake.
                          Starting the pod is then blocked until the unrelated PVC
                          is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is meant to be used
                          by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an owner reference
                          to the pod once the pod exists. Normally this should not
                          be necessary, but it may be useful when manually reconstructing
                          a broken cluster. \n This field is read-only and no changes

                                  There are three important differences between dataSource
                                  and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource only allows
                                  two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef allows
                                  any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                  objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
                                  (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                  and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                  specified. * While dataSource only allows local
                                  objects, dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces.

                              allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                              objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
                              (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                              and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef
                              allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this
                              field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate
                              to be enabled. (Alpha) Using the namespace field of
                              dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource
                              feature gate to be enabled.'

                              Apart from above values - keys that are unprefixed or
                              have kubernetes.io prefix are considered reserved and
                              hence may not be used. \n Capacity reported here may
                              be larger than the actual capacity when a volume expansion
                              operation is requested. For storage quota, the larger
                              value from allocatedResources and PVC.spec.resources
                              is used. If allocatedResources is not set, PVC.spec.resources
                              alone is used for quota calculation. If a volume expansion
                              capacity request is lowered, allocatedResources is only
                              lowered if there are no expansion operations in progress
                              and if the actual volume capacity is equal or lower
                              than the requested capacity. \n A controller that receives
                              PVC update with previously unknown resourceName should
                              ignore the update for the purpose it was designed. For
                              example - a controller that only is responsible for
                              resizing capacity of the volume, should ignore PVC updates
                              that change other valid resources associated with PVC.

                                    This field will replace the functionality of the
                                    dataSource field and as such if both fields are
                                    non-empty, they must have the same value. For
                                    backwards compatibility, when namespace isn''t
                                    specified in dataSourceRef, both fields (dataSource
                                    and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same value
                                    automatically if one of them is empty and the
                                    other is non-empty. When namespace is specified
                                    in dataSourceRef, dataSource isn''t set to the
                                    same value and must be empty. There are three
                                    important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types
                                    of objects, dataSourceRef allows any non-core
                                    object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping
                                    them), dataSourceRef preserves all values, and
                                    generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects,
                                    dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces.

                  that a Route wants to be attached to. Note that the referenced parent
                  resource needs to allow this for the attachment to be complete.
                  For Gateways, that means the Gateway needs to allow attachment from
                  Routes of this kind and namespace. For Services, that means the
                  Service must either be in the same namespace for a \"producer\"
                  route, or the mesh implementation must support and allow \"consumer\"
                  routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is not applicable
                  for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to create
                  a \"producer\" route for a Service in a different namespace from
                  the Route. \n There are two kinds of parent resources with \"Core\"
                  support: \n * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)  * Service (Mesh
                  conformance profile, experimental, ClusterIP Services only)  This
                  API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of
                  parent resources. \n ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either
                  that: \n * They select different objects.  If this is the case,
                  then parentRef entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means
                  that the multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`,
                  and `name` must be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
                  * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field
                  used, each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same
                  set of optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets
                  a combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.
                  \n Some examples: \n * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all
                  ParentRefs referencing the same object must also set `sectionName`.
                  * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
                  object must also set `port`. * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`
                  and `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same object must also
                  set `sectionName` and `port`. \n It is possible to separately reference
                  multiple distinct objects that may be collapsed by an implementation.
                  For example, some implementations may choose to merge compatible
                  Gateway Listeners together. If that is the case, the list of routes
                  attached to those resources should also be merged. \n Note that
                  for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
                  rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                  allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For
                  example, Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant
                  provides a generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace
                  reference. \n  ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same
                  namespace are \"producer\" routes, which apply default routing rules
                  to inbound connections from any namespace to the Service. \n ParentRefs
                  from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are \"consumer\"
                  routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound connections
                  originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which the
                  intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as
                  a ParentRef of the Route.  \n "

                            It can be interpreted differently based on the type of
                            parent resource. \n When the parent resource is a Gateway,
                            this targets all listeners listening on the specified
                            port that also support this kind of Route(and select this
                            Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                            networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to
                            a specific port as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s)
                            may be changed. When both Port and SectionName are specified,
                            the name and port of the selected listener must match
                            both specified values. \n  When the parent resource is
                            a Service, this targets a specific port in the Service
                            spec. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are
                            specified, the name and port of the selected port must
                            match both specified values.  \n Implementations MAY choose
                            to support other parent resources. Implementations supporting
                            other types of parent resources MUST clearly document
                            how/if Port is interpreted. \n For the purpose of status,
                            an attachment is considered successful as long as the
                            parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them
                            by Route kind, namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway
                            listeners accept attachment from the referencing Route,
                            the Route MUST be considered successfully attached. If
                            no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                            the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                            not supported for any other purpose. \n Implementations
                            MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.

                            one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example,
                            Gateway listeners can restrict which Routes can attach
                            to them by Route kind, namespace, or hostname. If 1 of
                            2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from the referencing
                            Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully attached.
                            If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                            the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                        For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                        the restart behavior is defined by the Pod''s restart policy
                        and the container type. Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always"
                        for the init container will have the following effect: this
                        init container will be continually restarted on exit until
                        all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular containers
                        have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                        will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init
                        containers and is often referred to as a "sidecar" container.
                        Although this init container still starts in the init container
                        sequence, it does not wait for the container to complete before
                        proceeding to the next init container. Instead, the next init
                        container starts immediately after this init container is
                        started, or after any startupProbe has successfully completed.'

                                  backwards compatibility, when namespace isn''t specified
                                  in dataSourceRef, both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef)

                                  isn''t set to the same value and must be empty.
                                  There are three important differences between dataSource
                                  and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource only allows
                                  two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef allows
                                  any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                  objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
                                  (dropping them), dataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                  and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                  specified. * While dataSource only allows local
                                  objects, dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces.

                              and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef
                              allows objects in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this

                                    important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types
                                    of objects, dataSourceRef allows any non-core
                                    object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping
                                    them), dataSourceRef preserves all values, and
                                    generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects,
                                    dataSourceRef allows objects in any namespaces.

                  any hostnames, or have specified at least one of `test.example.com`

                  that a Route wants to be attached to. Note that the referenced parent
                  resource needs to allow this for the attachment to be complete.
                  For Gateways, that means the Gateway needs to allow attachment from
                  Routes of this kind and namespace. For Services, that means the
                  Service must either be in the same namespace for a \"producer\"
                  route, or the mesh implementation must support and allow \"consumer\"
                  routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is not applicable
                  for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to create
                  a \"producer\" route for a Service in a different namespace from
                  the Route. \n There are two kinds of parent resources with \"Core\"
                  support: \n * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)  * Service (Mesh
                  conformance profile, experimental, ClusterIP Services only)  This
                  API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of
                  parent resources. \n ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either
                  that: \n * They select different objects.  If this is the case,
                  then parentRef entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means
                  that the multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`,
                  and `name` must be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
                  * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field
                  used, each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same
                  set of optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets
                  a combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.
                  \n Some examples: \n * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all
                  ParentRefs referencing the same object must also set `sectionName`.
                  * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
                  object must also set `port`. * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`
                  and `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same object must also
                  set `sectionName` and `port`. \n It is possible to separately reference
                  multiple distinct objects that may be collapsed by an implementation.
                  For example, some implementations may choose to merge compatible
                  Gateway Listeners together. If that is the case, the list of routes
                  attached to those resources should also be merged. \n Note that
                  for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
                  rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                  allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For
                  example, Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant
                  provides a generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace
                  reference. \n  ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same
                  namespace are \"producer\" routes, which apply default routing rules
                  to inbound connections from any namespace to the Service. \n ParentRefs
                  from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are \"consumer\"
                  routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound connections
                  originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which the
                  intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as

                  for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to create
                  a \"producer\" route for a Service in a different namespace from
                  the Route. \n There are two kinds of parent resources with \"Core\"
                  support: \n * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)  * Service (Mesh
                  conformance profile, experimental, ClusterIP Services only)  This
                  API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of
                  parent resources. \n ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either
                  that: \n * They select different objects.  If this is the case,
                  then parentRef entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means
                  that the multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`,
                  and `name` must be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.
                  * They do not select different objects, but for each optional field
                  used, each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same
                  set of optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets
                  a combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.
                  \n Some examples: \n * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all
                  ParentRefs referencing the same object must also set `sectionName`.
                  * If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same
                  object must also set `port`. * If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`
                  and `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same object must also
                  set `sectionName` and `port`. \n It is possible to separately reference
                  multiple distinct objects that may be collapsed by an implementation.
                  For example, some implementations may choose to merge compatible
                  Gateway Listeners together. If that is the case, the list of routes
                  attached to those resources should also be merged. \n Note that
                  for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific
                  rules. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                  allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For
                  example, Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant
                  provides a generic way to enable other kinds of cross-namespace
                  reference. \n  ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same
                  namespace are \"producer\" routes, which apply default routing rules
                  to inbound connections from any namespace to the Service. \n ParentRefs
                  from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are \"consumer\"
                  routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound connections
                  originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which the
                  intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as
                  a ParentRef of the Route.  \n "

                            a specific port as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s)
                            may be changed. When both Port and SectionName are specified,

                            both specified values. \n  When the parent resource is
                            a Service, this targets a specific port in the Service
                            spec. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are

                            by Route kind, namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway
                            listeners accept attachment from the referencing Route,
                            the Route MUST be considered successfully attached. If
                            no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                            the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                            If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                            the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                    type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage
                    when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields
                    which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion
                    and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid
                    usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual
                    usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular restrictions
                    like, \"must refer only to types A and B\" or \"UID not honored\"
                    or \"name must be restricted\". Those cannot be well described
                    when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages
                    are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which
                    makes it hard for users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields
                    are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise
                    mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                    and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is
                    on the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual struct
                    is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type
                    is embedded in many locations, updates to this type will affect
                    numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified
                    API type they do not control. \n Instead of using this type, create
                    a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your
                    reference. For example, ServiceReferences for admission registration:

                    type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage
                    when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields
                    which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion
                    and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid
                    usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual
                    usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular restrictions
                    like, \"must refer only to types A and B\" or \"UID not honored\"
                    or \"name must be restricted\". Those cannot be well described
                    when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages
                    are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which
                    makes it hard for users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields
                    are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise
                    mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                    and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is
                    on the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual struct
                    is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type
                    is embedded in many locations, updates to this type will affect
                    numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified
                    API type they do not control. \n Instead of using this type, create
                    a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your
                    reference. For example, ServiceReferences for admission registration:

                        For example, if the object reference is to a container within
